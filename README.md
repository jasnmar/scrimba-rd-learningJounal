Part of the Scrimba.com Frontend career path.

Primary goal was around mobile first layout and then adding fucntionality for bigger screens.

Some interesting challenges about hiding content on mobile and showing it where there's more space avaialble at desktop sizes.

I decided to not author the HTLM for the most part, but to write reusable js functions for the nav, footer and main blog sections.
